One Sentence Description
Exact Measure converts distance measurements from Metric to Imperial and back again

Detailed Description
Using Exact Measure, you can specify any distance measurement in either Imperial units (feet, inches, yards, and miles) or Metric (millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers).  That distance will be converted to the equivalent measure in the specified unit to 4 significant digits.  If you ask for Imperial units, you will also receive the full measure in miles, feet, inches, and fractions of an inch.


Example Phrases 
	- https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/devconsole/launch-your-skill.html#example-phrases
	- The skill's first example phrase should contain the wake word and invocation name. 
	- All must match exactly the samples in InteractionModel.json
    - must wait for model to fully finish building before submitting
	- do not start intent samples in the json with "to"
		- this failed the example phrase submission: "to convert {inputValue} {sourceType} to {destType}"
		- this passed: "convert {inputValue} {sourceType} to {destType}"
	- these samples worked with just the WithoutDecimal intent defined and all English variants defined
	        "samples": [
                        "{inputValue} {sourceType} to {destType} ",
                        "{inputValue} {sourceType} into {destType} ",
                        "{inputValue} {sourceType} in {destType} ",
                        "for {inputValue} {sourceType} in {destType} ",
                        "change {inputValue} {sourceType} into {destType}",
                        "give me {inputValue} {sourceType} in {destType}",
                        "convert {inputValue} {sourceType} to {destType}",
                        "tell me what {inputValue} {sourceType} in {destType} is",
                        "give me {inputValue} {sourceType} in {destType}",
                        "whats {inputValue} {sourceType} in {destType}",
                        "what is {inputValue} {sourceType} in {destType}",
                        "now give me {inputValue} {sourceType} in {destType}",
                        "what about {inputValue} {sourceType} in {destType}"
                    ]
        - and these example phrases:
            -Alexa, ask exact measure to convert 67 meters to feet
            -now give me 10 centimeters in inches
            -what about 22 inches in millimeters
Alexa, ask exact measure to convert 67 meters to feet
Alexa, ask exact measure to change 10 centimeters into inches
Alexa, ask exact measure to tell me what 22 centimeters in inches is


testing instructions
I have added several items that were requested by my Amazon Reviewer
 - I have cards for every response
 - I added reprompts for every response
 - I updated the meta data

I have also added an additional intent for "TryAgain".  This lets the user change target
metrics without having to resubmit the query.  For example:
 - What is 4 feet in millimeters
 -    what about in centimeters
This new intent also allows for "please repeat that" type interactions.

There are no special testing requirements.  This skill does not save any information, 
nor need to know the identity of the user.  When converting to Imperial measures the 
skill will give both the decimal value and in fractions of an inch.

I have also fixed a bug in converting Imperial measurements to other Imperial measurements,
such as miles to feet or inches.
